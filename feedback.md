10% - Java Project setup (no specific IDE, just so that it runs)

```diff
+ Setup was simple to do
```

10% - .jar file inclusion (instead of copying/pasting classes), packaging as an executable .jar file for submission

```diff
+ JSON libraries were used as .jar file
- Included the client build .jar file
```

10% - Network/Server connection and communication with other clients

```diff
+ This is all functional and appears to be happening correctly based on your API
```

 5% - git / connection to GitHub
 
```diff
+ Connected to GitHub, commits are pushed
```

 5% - frequent commits (pertaining to code changes, not time)
 
```diff
+ Commits are much better - I could use some more, but the messages and commits are a significant improvement
```

35% - completion (how much of the game you can play)

```diff
- Gameplay is basically complete, there are some issues with display - -1
```

25% - Usability / Code standards / best practices / error & exception handling

```diff
- The cards drop back down if hovered for longer than a tick - display refresh causes some issue
-     with how users will work with the game
- Display can stop refreshing at some points - game play still functions as long as no cards are drawn
- Unused code / unused variable - -3
- You're accessing static code as though it were an instance variable (Main line 72) - not a good idea,
-     can result in some strange results if changes are made
```
